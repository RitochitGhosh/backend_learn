### 🧠 Node.js Architecture

Let’s break this down step by step.

### 🌐 What Happens When You Visit a Website?

- Imagine you're an **end user**, trying to open a website — say `youtube.com`.
- You're using a **browser** like **Google Chrome**, which acts as the **client**.
- The **client** sends a request to the website’s **server** (which hosts the website’s code/data).
- The **server** receives that request, processes it, and sends back a **response**.
- The **browser (client)** then receives the response and displays the content.

### 🤔 How Does the Server Handle Multiple Requests?

Now, let’s assume the server is built using **Node.js**.

- Node.js is **single-threaded**, meaning it uses a single main thread to handle all operations.
- But despite being single-threaded, **Node.js can handle many requests at the same time**.  
- This is possible because of something called the **Event Loop** — the heart of Node.js.

### 🔄 What is the Event Loop?

The **Event Loop** is a smart mechanism that allows Node.js to handle multiple operations *without* blocking the main thread.

Here’s how it works:

1. **All incoming requests** are placed into a **queue**.
2. The **Event Loop** continuously checks this queue.
3. If the main thread is **free**, it picks the next task and processes it.
4. If the request is **blocking** (e.g., reading a file), Node.js offloads that task to a separate system (like a thread pool) and continues checking the queue.

### ⏳ Types of Requests

There are two kinds of operations a server deals with:

#### 1. **Synchronous Requests**
- These are quick and executed immediately.
- The server waits for the operation to finish before moving to the next one.
- Example: Simple calculations, data formatting, etc.

#### 2. **Asynchronous Requests**
- These are time-consuming and don’t block the main thread.
- Example: Reading a file, querying a database, calling an external API.

### 🧵 Thread Pool

For **asynchronous** operations, Node.js uses a **Thread Pool** behind the scenes (thanks to **libuv** — a C++ library).

- The **Thread Pool** is a set of threads (default is 4) that can handle heavy tasks in the background.
- When such a task comes in, it is **delegated to the thread pool**, and the **main thread remains free** to handle other incoming requests.

---

### 🗂 In Summary:

- Node.js handles many requests at once **using a non-blocking, event-driven architecture**.
- The **Event Loop** + **Thread Pool** combination makes this possible.
- Even though Node.js is single-threaded, it can scale very well and handle thousands of requests concurrently.
